# MStoreDelivery-Flutter

A MobileApp developed by me and a colleague for the commercial use of Talanton S.A. It is centered around local business and its goal is to get the most from a limited number of delivery guys. 
It is solely using the Flutter framework and the Dart language and it uses REST API protocol to comminucate with the Web application.

Due to it being commercial, this public repository is in a "broken form" meaning that there are some files missing to avoid the misuse of our product by 3rd parties.
