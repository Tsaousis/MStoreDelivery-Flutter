# MStoreDelivery-Flutter

A MobileApp developed by me and a colleague for the commercial use of Talanton S.A. It is centered around local business and its goal is to get the most from a limited number of delivery guys. 
It is developed via the Flutter framework and the Dart language, for both Android and Ios devices, and it makes use of the REST API protocol to communicate with the Web application.

Due to it being commercial, this public repository is in a "broken form" meaning that there are some files missing to avoid the misuse of our product by 3rd parties.
If you want to have further information about this project, you can contact me on tsaousiscosta@gmail.com
You can also download the apk (orders.apk) to test the app yourself on an Android device.

For the Web App you can have a look here https://github.com/Tsaousis/MStoreDelivery-Django

Below there are some photos of the demo of the delivery guys' app.
